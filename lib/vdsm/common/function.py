    Retry a function. Wraps the retry logic so you don't have to
    implement it each time you need it.

    :param expectedException: The exception you expect to receive when the
                              function fails.
    :param tries: The number of times to try. None\0,-1 means infinite.
    :param timeout: The time you want to spend waiting. This **WILL NOT** stop
                    the method. It will just not run it if it ended after the
                    timeout.
    :param sleep: Time to sleep between calls in seconds.
    :param stopCallback: A function that takes no parameters and causes the
                         method to stop retrying when it returns with a
                         positive value.
